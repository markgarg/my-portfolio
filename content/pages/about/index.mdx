### I'm Rohit Macherla.

I am a passionate software developer with a background in Computer Science. I love to learn new things and I'm always learning new things. I'm also a big fan of reading and writing.

I've been working on Salesforce.com for more than 10 years now. During this time, and before that, I've also worked with Java, Node.js, React.js, Python, and a little bit of Scala.

My biggest strengths are rapid learning, adapting, and an ability to foresee challenges. I bring with me a holistic approach to solve your business problems.

This blog is my space for sharing my thoughts and ideas. You would find that it does not contain the ordinary stuff like a rejig of the documentation. It contains my ideas, some concepts that I played with, and my thoughts on solving some problems.
