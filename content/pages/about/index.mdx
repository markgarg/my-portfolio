import Timeline from "../../../src/components/Timeline/Timeline";

I'm Rohit Macherla.

I am a passionate software developer with a background in Computer Science. I love to learn new things and I'm always learning new things. I'm also a big fan of reading and writing.

I've been working on `Salesforce.com` for more than 10 years now. During this time, and before that, I've also worked with `Java`, `Node.js`, `React.js`, `Python`, and a little bit of `Scala`.

My biggest strengths are rapid learning, adapting, and an ability to foresee challenges. I bring with me a holistic approach to solve your business problems.

This blog is my space for sharing my thoughts and ideas. You would find that it does not contain the ordinary stuff like a rejig of the documentation. It contains my ideas, some concepts that I played with, and my thoughts on solving some problems.
