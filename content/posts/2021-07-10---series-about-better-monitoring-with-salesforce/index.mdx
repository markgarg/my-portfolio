description: A series of blog posts about advanced monitoring techniques so your business can rely on your tech team.

This is a series of blog posts about advanced monitoring techniques so your business can rely on the tech team.

Here's what we will cover:
1. [A case for better monitoring](/a-case-for-better-monitoring)
2. [Slack alerts for Salesforce.com](/slack-alerts-for-salesforce)
3. [Taking it to the next level for monitoring the Salesforce.com Enterprise](/next-level-monitoring-for-your-salesforce-enterprise)
4. [Installing Prometheus](/installing-prometheus-on-heroku)
5. Exposing a Salesforce API that Prometheus can call
6. Wiring it up - integrating Salesforce with Prometheus
7. Wrapping the series!

I hope this helps tech teams to go beyond the regular incident management and be on top of what's happening with your Salesforce org.
